1.The dataset first downloaded is 2019.1.13-2019.1.20. The latest time of file upload is July 14, 2020.

2.The dataset is downloaded from NCBI  Nucleotide Database Support Center according to the six types of viruses under the Baltimore virus classification system.

3.The specific download method is as follows:

According to the latest introduction of the virus classification system in the tenth report of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses, 
we learned that viruses could be roughly classified into six groups based on the Baltimore virus classification system. 
These six groups include double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), justice single-stranded RNA ((+)ss RNA),
 antisense single-stranded RNA ((-)ss RNA), Retrovirus (Retro) .In the database of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/), 
we searched for Family when limited Species, Molecule types, and Sequence length. Furthermore, selected viruses and genomic DNA/RNA with sequence lengths ranging from hundreds to thousands of BP.

 4.Finally, we downloaded 82960 gene sequences, including all six groups of viruses. The specific quantity of each type of virus data was shown as follows. 

Group	Quantity
dsDNA	11860
dsRNA	15800
Retro	15800
ssDNA	7900
(-)ssRNA	15800
(+)ssRNA	15800

5.Due to the limitation of upload file size, we divided dsDNA virus into 7 files to be compressed and uploaded, and the other five viruses were compressed and uploaded respectively.
